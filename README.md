Blinkenlights
-------------

We are working with strands of [Adafruit WS2801 LED pixels](https://www.adafruit.com/products/322), configured in a grid installed
on ceiling tiles. For more information on basic wiring and led function, see their [tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/12mm-led-pixels/).

We're using the [Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) to drive the array.

### Requirements

- You'll need to install [Andy Brown's port of the C++ std library](http://andybrown.me.uk/wk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/).
