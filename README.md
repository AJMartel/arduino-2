Blinkenlights
-------------

We are working with strands of [Adafruit WS2801 LED pixels](https://www.adafruit.com/products/322). For more information on basic wiring
and led function, see their [tutorial](http://learn.adafruit.com/12mm-led-pixels/).

We're using the [Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) to drive the array.

### paneltest

paneltest is a simple library to work with subsets of the strand.
